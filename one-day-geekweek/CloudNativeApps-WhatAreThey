 Cloud Native requires that application design be done to decouple from physical resources
 Cloud Native Apps make the most of Cloud Resources
 
Key Points: 
 * The Twelve-Factor App: A collection of cloud native app architecture patterns
 * Microservices: Independently deployable services that do one thing well

 * API-based Collaboration: Published and versioned APIs that allow interaction between services in a cloud native app architecture
 * Anti-Fragility: Systems that get stronger when subjected to stress
